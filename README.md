# 🎓 End-to-End ML Toy Project | Placement Prediction using Logistic Regression

This is an end-to-end machine learning project that predicts whether a student is likely to get placed or not based on their **CGPA** and **IQ**. The goal is to help beginners understand the full workflow of building and deploying a simple ML model.

## 🧠 Problem Statement

> Can we predict if a student will be placed based on academic and cognitive metrics?

We use a binary classification approach with **Logistic Regression** to classify whether a student will be placed (`1`) or not (`0`) using the following features:
- **CGPA (Cumulative Grade Point Average)**
- **IQ (Intelligence Quotient)**

## 📁 Project Structure




##  🔍 Workflow
1. **Data Collection**
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
3. **Data Preprocessing**
4. **Model Building (Logistic Regression)**
5. **Model Evaluation**
6. **Visualization**
7. *(Optional)* Deployment using Streamlit or Flask

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset includes:
- `CGPA`: Academic performance indicator
- `IQ`: Cognitive ability score
- `Placed`: Target variable (1 = Placed, 0 = Not Placed)

## Tech Stack


- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib & Seaborn (for EDA)
- Jupyter Notebook


## 🚀 About Me
I'm a full stack developer...

Hi, I'm Murli Sharma — a passionate Data Science enthusiast currently pursuing my M.Sc. in Big Data Analytics at St. Xavier's College, Ahmedabad. I love building simple yet meaningful machine learning projects that help strengthen core concepts.

This repository is a part of my learning journey where I’ve applied Logistic Regression to predict student placement based on CGPA and IQ. It reflects my growing interest in applied machine learning and building data-driven solutions from scratch.
